# Mountain Car

The agent (a car) is started at the bottom of a valley. For any given state
the agent may choose to accelerate to the left, right or cease any
acceleration. The code is originally based on [this code](http://incompleteideas.net/MountainCar/MountainCar1.cp)
and the environment appeared first in Andrew Moore's PhD Thesis (1990):

    author = {Andrew William Moore},
    title = {Efficient Memory-based Learning for Robot Control},
    institution = {},
    year = {1990}
}
```

Observation space is a 2-dim vector, where the 1st element represents the "car position" and the 2nd element represents the "car velocity".

There are 3 discrete deterministic actions:
- 0: Accelerate to the Left
- 1: Don't accelerate
- 2: Accelerate to the Right

Reward: Reward of 0 is awarded if the agent reached the flag
(position = 0.5) on top of the mountain. Reward of -1 is awarded if the position of the agent is less than 0.5.

Starting State: The position of the car is assigned a uniform random value in [-0.6 , -0.4]. The starting velocity of the car is always assigned to 0.

Episode Termination: The car position is more than 0.5. Episode length is greater than 200
