**The Gym interface is simple, pythonic, and capable of representing general RL problems:**

```{code-block} python

   import gym
   env = gym.make("LunarLander-v2")
   observation, info = env.reset(seed=42, return_info=True)
   for _ in range(1000):
      env.render()
      action = policy(observation)
      observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)

      if done:
         observation, info = env.reset(return_info=True)
   env.close()
```
